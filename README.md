# Computer-Vision-Projects
The projects in these repository were created for the purposes of the Computer Vision course, at the 7th semester of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Department at Democritus University of Thrace. Each folder consists of the images used, the project description, the code developed and a technical report in Greek &amp; English.



<b>First project: Document Structure Analysis</b>

Given an image database of scanned documents:
1) Create a bounding box around each area of interest in every image. Area of interest is defined as a part of the document that can be distinct from the rest parts of the document, such as page indexing, paragraphs, document title, etc.
2) For each area of interest compute:
  
     i. The area of text contained by the area

     ii. Area of its corresponding bounding box

     iii. Number of words in each area

     iv. Mean grayscale value in each box, with a method, whose runtime is independent of the size of that specific area.

<b>Second project: Creation of a panorama image</b>
Given a batch of images create their panorama image:
1) Using SIFT Descriptor
2) Using SURF Descriptor

<b>Third project: Image classification using Knn and SVM classifiers</b>
Given an image dataset depicting traffic signs, classify them using:
1) Using Knn classifier
2) Using SVM classifier

Experiment using different values of k and different types of kernels. 
The images are stored in a zip in the following link:
